# ORC-01 DNS Gate Verification Evidence

Goal: Demonstrate that HTTP validation refuses to start before DNS phase completion.

Instructions:
1. Create a new campaign (ID: <campaign_id>).
2. Ensure DNS phase status != completed (leave pending or simulate failure).
3. Attempt to Execute HTTP validation.
4. Capture log line containing: "DNS phase not completed" and the campaign_id.
5. Complete DNS phase (manually mark or run DNS validator until completed).
6. Re-attempt HTTP validation Execute -> succeeds (no warning log). Capture success log: "HTTP validation completed successfully".
7. Paste both log snippets below.

--- LOG SNIPPETS ---
# Failure (expected gate):

# Success after DNS completion:

Timestamp: <add when captured>
Recorder: <engine / service>

Acceptance: Both snippets present and campaign IDs match.
